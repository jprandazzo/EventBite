# Eventbite
Welcome to Eventbite. This is a site by vampires, for vampires. I know how hungry you are, because I am too. And what better way to find your next meal by getting the humans to come to you?
Thankfully, we have the power of the internet at our fingertips (things sure have changed since I was young back in the 1670s). Eventbite will allow you to create events AND buy tickets to others' events - you can really double dip with this one (pun intended) and have some fun while you feast. And don't worry, humans see this site as a normal Eventbrite; only our dark magic allows us to see the truth.

In order to build Eventbite, I used the following technologies:
* Languages: Javascript, Ruby, HTML, and CSS
* Other frameworks: Rails, React, and React-Redux. Google Maps API Integration coming soon.
* Hosting on Render, database in PostgreSQL,
